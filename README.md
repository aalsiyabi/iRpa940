# iRpa940
Genome scale metabolic model of Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009

The folder labeled 'iRpa940_GAMS_simulations' contains simulated growth on the four carbon sources discussed in the paper (Alsiyabi et al., 2019). 
The simulations were performed using GAMS and therefore require a licensed copy of the software. 

An SBML and excel version of the model are also provided to recreate simulation results using other software.
